      <a href="https://vimeo.com/735138385" target="_blank">In this video</a> 
      I portrayed the temporal evolution of the content of the files stored at the European Southern Observatory 
      <a href="http://www.eso.org" target="_blank">(ESO)</a> Science Archive Facility <a href="http://archive.eso.org/cms.html" target="_blank">(SAF)</a>
      from the begin of the creation of the ESO archive (1998) till now.

      <p>
      Each point represent a single file contained in the ESO archive in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_coordinate_system" target="_blank">galactic coordinates</a>. 
      The calibration files (like bias, dark, flat fields, etc) are not considered. 
      The points represent any kind of data in the ESO archive: images, spectra, data cubes, interferometry, radio. 
      For visualization purposes the size of each point is fixed and doesn't represent the real extent in the sky of the data. 
      The color scale represent the density of files in the sky.

      Here there is an annotated version of the content of the archive in July 2022.
      The ESO archive contains data collected with ESO telescopes and also from UKIRT telescope
      in the northern emisphere.
      This map represent the data stored in the ESO archive in galactic Aitoff projection.
      The galactic center is at the center of the image, the galactic equator is horizontal at the middle of the image.
      On the left side of the image the galactic longitude increase from 0 to 180,
      while on the right side it decrease from 360 to 180.
      The almost empty region on the left of the image is the region of the sky at declinations 
      greater than 45 degrees, where ESO telescopes cannot observe.
      Due to their intrinsic interest, some regions of the sky are observed more often 
      than others, like the 
      the Galactic Center region, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud,
      the star forming region of &rho; Ophiuchi.
      The region along the galactic plane, is filled with data from the VISTA/VVV survey (southern emisphere)
      and from data from UKIRT/WFCAM (northern emisphere).
      The overdensities at high galactic latitudes are generated by the surveys (imaging) 
      conducted with VISTA and VST telescopes.
