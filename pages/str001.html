<p>
I visited the Montiraqui impact crater two times in 2016 and 2019.

The crater is quite isolated and the roads/tracks to reach it are in very bad status.
For this reason I collected here some travel trip suggestions for visiting the place.
The crater is in the Antofagasta region, Chile at coordinates 23째55'41.40"S  68째15'41.91"W.
</p>
<p>
There is no telephone network in a radius of about 40 km from the crater itself,
in the same radius there is no any source of water, and no one lives in the same radius.
The altitude of the crater is significative because it is at 3400 m a.s.l.
Pay particular attention to the solar radiation because is almost sunny every day
and the radiation is extremely strong, so use long clothes and a high factor solar protector 
on exposed part of the body and expecially the lips.
</p>
<p>
Till now it is the only recognized impact crater in Chile, and it has a diameter of 400m,
and was probably formed 600 kyr ago by the impact of a metallic meteorite.
Analysis of the crater have shows that there are no fragment left of the original meteorite.
Probably most of them were recollected in pre-incaic/incaic times since the crater is located at
few hundred meters from the Inca road that connected in straight line Peine with Copiapo.

<h2>Arrival to San Pedro de Atacama</h2>
<p>
Flight from Santiago to Calama, do not make the mistake to take the flight to the Desierto de Atacama Airport that is 700 km south of San Pedro de Atacama.
 
At Calama airport rent the 4x4 car. For security reason plan to go with in 2 cars with experienced drivers of off-road. 
Buy all the food, water and other stuff in the mall in Calama, San Pedro de Atacama has some small shops were you can found bread and fruits, 
but they are not very big shops, and maybe you cannot encounter what you need.
Drive from Calama to San Pedro de Atacama, and pass the night here.
Before leaving to the crater, be sure to contact the Carabineros de Chile in San Pedro de Atacama and provide them the full information about your trip details.
(Carabineros de Chile are the only ones that can help you in case of problems, i.e. mechanical problem with the cars, etc)
</p>

<h2>San Pedro to Montiraqui crater</h2>

<p>
Drive from San Pedro de Atacama to the south east along the road n. 23 that border the Salar de Atacama.
Along the road you encounter the access portal to the astronomical observatory of ALMA.
Pass trough Toconao, 3 km after this town at the intersection with B-355 follow straight along the route n.23. 
Route B-355 is not paved, but covered with bichufita (salt) and hence is slower than route n.23.
Continue for 30 km, then just before a big red hill on the right, take the road B-379 on the right, and follow it for 7 km up to the intersection with B-355.
At the intersection take on the left, and from here B-355 is paved.
Follow the road for 23 km up to the town of Peine (nice very old church, old historic houses and rock art).
Pass the town and follow the main road for about 11 km in direction Tilomonte.
</p>
<p>
The main road (paved) go toward a lithium mine, take the intersection to the left direction Tilomonte
(if the road is not clearly visible follow the direction of the big trees that are visible) for about 1 km.
Here you encounter an intersection and turn on the right (no road signals), without entering in Tilomonte, 
the first kilometers are difficult because the road disseminated by rocks left by some flooding 
(the road pass in an alluvial fan).
Drive with caution for the next 15 km, then go up the hill paying attention to the holes in the road.
At the top of the hill drive for about 9 km in a flat land, where
you can have a paramount vision of volcanoes Pular an Socompa.
</p>
<p>
When you descend from the flat you will cross an high voltage line,
here take the track on the right and follow it for about 350 m, then take the track on 
the left that climb the hill.
</p>
<p>
<i>
This part is the most difficult part of the track for about 10 km, that is far from a good shape.
The floodings of period 2015-2018, have almost cancelled the previous existing track
and in some point the road is completely missing, obliging you to drive completely off-road 
in some potential dangerous situations due to the presence of many cliffs.
A pair of shovels and some metallic axes could help passing the most difficult part of the road.
</i>
</p>
<p>
A previous safe place to park the car in 2016 was at these coordinates 
23째56'15.81"S  68째15'45.14"W, that was a reasonable walking distance from the crater (1 km) 
in north direction.
However the floodings make this site no more accessible, so the best solution is continue until
the road cross the creek turning on the right.
At this point some tracks turn on the right going backward. The right one for going to the crater
is indicated by a pile of rocks near a electrical tower.
</p>
<p>
Now follow the track for about 4 km, you first found a pirca (house made with rocks).
This is the actual best place to station the car for not damaging the site of the crater.
With a short walk of about 1 km you will reach the rim of the crater.
</p>

<h2>PRESERVATION RULES</h2>
<p>
For preservation of the site, when you are in the crater and in the surroundings, 
please do not collect any rocks, do not make excavations also do not interfere 
with the site moving elements, or damaging rocks, plants, animals.
</p>
<p>
Some people already caused damages to the site entering with cars and trucks to 
the bottom of the crater, other have made illegal excavations, do not copy those unfair behaviour.
